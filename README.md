## Getting Started

#### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

#### Start Dev Server
```
npm run watch
```

## Usage

**Routes:**
- You may start adding new routes to the `/routes` folder.
- All routes are imported into `app.js` for route prefixing.

**Controllers:**
- Controllers are where we recommend keeping the business logic.
- We recommend keeping business logic and route logic separate.

**Models:**
- We use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the Database ORM for MongoDB.
- We keep all the model schemas and data structures within `/models`.

## Common Issues
If you run into Babel 7.0.0 version not compatible error, simply remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` whichever applies, then run:
```
npm install
npm clean-install
```

and then it should straighten out your babel issue.
